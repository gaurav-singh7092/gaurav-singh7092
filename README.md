## 🚀 About Me

I’m an IIIT Gwalior undergrad building production-ready apps and ML models. I thrive on architecting scalable, high-performance systems—from real-time trading bots to microservices-powered streaming platforms. In my free time, I mentor coding workshops, write tech tutorials, and explore the latest in AI/ML research.
